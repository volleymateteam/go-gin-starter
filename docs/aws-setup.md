# AWS Infrastructure Setup for Volleymate

This document outlines the finalized AWS architecture and configuration decisions made for the Volleymate platform. Each decision aims to optimize cost, performance, and maintainability.

âœ… Completed Steps

1. S3 Lifecycle Rule
   â€¢ Rule: Move raw videos to Glacier Deep Archive after 30 days.
   â€¢ Why: Saves up to 80% storage cost.
   â€¢ Path: videos/.../raw/
   â€¢ Status: Enabled via Lifecycle rule with prefix videos/.

2. EC2 Instance Configuration
   â€¢ Instance type: t3.small
   â€¢ Region: eu-north-1 (Stockholm â€” cheapest in EU)
   â€¢ Storage: 30 GB gp3
   â€¢ Purpose: Runs Go Backend + FastAPI Parser
   â€¢ Status: âœ… Running with working HTTPS and services

3. SSL with Letâ€™s Encrypt
   â€¢ Domain: <https://api.volleymate.app>
   â€¢ Tool: Certbot
   â€¢ Location: /etc/letsencrypt/live/api.volleymate.app/
   â€¢ NGINX: Proxy + SSL Config Enabled
   â€¢ Status: âœ… Confirmed live

4. CloudFront Media Delivery
   â€¢ Domain: <https://d2qk7473q3y7pg.cloudfront.net>
   â€¢ Used for: Videos + Thumbnails
   â€¢ Status: Already integrated into upload pipeline

5. AWS Budgets + Alerts
   â€¢ Budget: $50/month
   â€¢ Alerts:
   â€¢ 50% Usage (Warn)
   â€¢ 80% Usage (Alert)
   â€¢ Status: âœ… Created with monthly recurring rule

ðŸ“¦ Cost Estimate (Monthly)

Item Estimated Cost (100 matches/mo)
S3 Storage ~$20 (Standard + Glacier after 30d)
CloudFront ~$5â€“10 for ~50â€“100 GB usage
EC2 (t3.small) ~$12
SQS <$1
Route 53 ~$1
Total $40â€“55 / month

â¸»

ðŸ”œ Next Steps (Future Improvements)
â€¢ Add Cache-Control headers for media
â€¢ Integrate CloudWatch custom metrics (SQS queue length, parser performance)
â€¢ Enable CDN caching rules for thumbnails
â€¢ Automate lifecycle policies via Terraform (optional)
â€¢ Set up CloudWatch alerts for S3 usage or EC2 CPU/memory

â¸»

ðŸ¤– Notes
â€¢ .dvw scout files are NOT archived â€” always accessible.
â€¢ Multiple compressed video formats are kept: 1080p, 720p, 480p
â€¢ Default returned to frontend: video_url (720p), plus video_urls map for UI flexibility
